<h2>An Excerpt from Honey Locust, by Mary Oliver</h2>
<p>
   Every year I gather <br><br> handfuls of blossoms
   and eat of their mealiness; the honey <br><br> melts
   in my mouth, the seeds make me strong, <br><br> both
   when they are crisp and ripe, and even at
   the end <br><br> when their petals have turned dully
   yellow. <br><br> So it is <br><br> if the heart has devoted
   itself to love, there is <br><br> not a single inch
   of emptiness. Gladness gleams <br><br> all the way to
   the grave.
