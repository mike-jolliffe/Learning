# Current Weather Website

![Website Snapshot](UI_screenshot.png)


## Functionality

This web app sends an AJAX request to the [Open Weather Maps API](https://openweathermap.org/current), passing your current location, and then
reports the current weather conditions.

Or if you'd prefer to put in a city name, the website will send an AJAX request for that city, instead.

You can toggle between temperature of Celsius or Fahrenheit.

The background image changes to reflect the current weather conditions for your location or the city you've chosen.
