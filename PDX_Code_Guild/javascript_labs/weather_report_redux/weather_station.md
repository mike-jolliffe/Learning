# Lab: Build a Weather Station

Create a webapp using the open weather map api that can:

1. Tell me the weather in my location by zip or city name.

1.  Change the background image depending on current conditions.

1. Tell me the current temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

Advanced:
1. Use [getCurrentPosition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/getCurrentPosition) to get my current location automatically.
